        <h1>Welcome to Earthbrine's Unofficial Akarahnet Wiki!</h1>
        <p><b>FYI: An official wiki will come eventually. However, this wiki is intended to hold not only info<br>
            about Akarahnet, but also tips, strats, and tools that the official wiki may not include. Therefore,<br>
        this wiki will stay up even after that change.</b></p>
